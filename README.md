## **Theoretical Background**
### Machine Learning in Healthcare
Machine learning models can analyze large datasets to make predictions that enhance treatment accuracy. In this project, machine learning is used to classify patients into drug categories based on health data.

### Drug Classification
Different drugs work better for different patients based on their health metrics. This system uses supervised learning algorithms to ensure personalized treatment for patients.

## **Model Evaluation**
- **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
- **Precision**: Indicates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the model's ability to detect all relevant cases.
- **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall for a comprehensive view of model performance.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes how well the model distinguishes between drug categories.

## **Challenges**
1. **Data Complexity**: Handling diverse and complex health data.
2. **Model Interpretability**: Making the model transparent and interpretable to healthcare providers.
3. **Bias and Fairness**: Ensuring that the model is unbiased and performs well across different demographics.

---

## **Future Directions**
1. **Integration with EHR Systems**: Real-time integration with Electronic Health Records for seamless use in clinical environments.
2. **Personalized Medicine**: Expanding the system to include genetic, lifestyle, and environmental data for more personalized drug recommendations.
3. **Advanced Algorithms**: Exploring neural networks and deep learning to improve model accuracy.
